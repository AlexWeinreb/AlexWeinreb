But from domain knowledge, 50 seems too high a cutoff: would we really call a gene with 25 papers poorly studied?\nWe can look at the number of genes in each category:\n\npapers_per_gene |&gt;\n  mutate(category = cut(nb_papers,\n                        breaks = c(-1, 3, 20, 250, Inf),\n                        labels = c(\"unstudied\", \"lowly\",\"medium\",\"highly\"))) |&gt; \n  summarize(nb_genes = n(),\n            .by = category)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  category  nb_genes\n  &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n1 highly          59\n2 medium        1308\n3 lowly         4602\n4 unstudied    43572\n\n\nSo, there are 59 highly studied genes, and another 1308 well-studied genes.

    "text": "Limitations\nFirst, we are interested in most studied genes, but we only looked at the most cited genes. For example, unc-54 is highly cited, but that may be largely due to its use in transgenes.\nSecond, for annotating tissue types, we rely on the curated expression patterns from Wormbase. Another approach is to use the scRNA-Seq data now available to determine expression patterns. For example, I previously used a thresholding approach to identify neuronal genes, this annotation is available in the minipackage wormDatasets.\nFinally, if we are interested in genes studied for their role in a given tissue (e.g. neurons), we would need a classification of the papers they’re cited in. Here, we rely on (sometimes imprecise) annotations of tissues where a gene is expressed. For example, daf-16 is expressed in neurons, and has been largely studied in all tissues, so it appears as the top hit; that does not necessarily mean it has been studied in neurons that much."
