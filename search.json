    "text": "Limitations\nFirst, we are interested in most studied genes, but we only looked at the most cited genes. For example, unc-54 is highly cited, but that may be largely due to its use in transgenes.\nSecond, if we are interested in genes studied for their role in a given tissue (e.g. neurons), we would need a classification of the papers they’re cited in. Here, we rely on (sometimes imprecise) annotations of tissues where a gene is expressed. For example, daf-16 is expressed in neurons, and has been largely studied in all tissues, so it appears as the top hit."
